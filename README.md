# PIC24-Spectrum-Analyzer-EE2361-Final-Project
Creating a spectrum analyzer based around a PIC24FJ64GA002 microcontroller. The goal is to record audio as a button is pressed, convert the analog audio signal to the frequency domain, and visually represent the result on an oled display, as well as playing a buzzer at the fundamental frequency.
