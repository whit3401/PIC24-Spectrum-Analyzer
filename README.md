# PIC24-Spectrum-Analyzer
Creating a spectrum analyzer based around a PIC24FJ64GA002 microcontroller. The goal is to take an audio sample when a button is pressed, convert the analog audio signal to the frequency domain, and visually represent the result on an OLED display, as well as playing a buzzer at the fundamental frequency.

Hardware Components used: PIC24FJ64GA002 Microcontroller, MAX9814 Electret Microphone, 128x64 Pixel SSD1306 OLED Display, PS1240P02BT Piezoelectric Buzzer, LM386 OpAmp
